**Requirements**:

Since the markdown file includes mathametical symbols, at least one of the following package should be installed:

1. the *markdown preview enhanced* package is required if viewed with ATOM or VS code. 
2. intall "MathJax Plugin for Github" in chrome addon store
3. Otherwise you could use the jupyter lab instead.
